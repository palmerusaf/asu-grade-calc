# ASU Grades Estimator
## Purpose
Some professors disable grade calculations in their courses because canvas doesn't always calculate grades correctly. This script tries to estimate what your current grade is and then replaces the calculation disable message.
## Example
| Before   | After    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| ![Before](./before.png)    | ![After](./after.png)    |
## How to use it
1. Navigate to the grades screen in canvas. The link should look something like `https://canvas.asu.edu/courses/<course-id>/grades`.

2. Press F-12 to bring up the dev tools.
3. Navigate to the console tab.
4. Paste the code block below into the console.
5. Type "allow pasting" or whatever the console tells you to do.
* Note: Be careful just pasting random scripts into dev tools. Someone could steal your bank info that way. I'm not going to, but someone could.

## Code Block to Paste
```javascript:getGrades.js

```
